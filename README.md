### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Sai Hruthik, I am a recent grad from UIC. I am currently looking for full-time roles as a Software Engineer/Software Developer/Java Developer. I am currently working in projects involving awesome technologies like Java(Spring Boot), MySQL, Node.js, Angular, etc. Please do check out my projects, they involve my work in Software Development and Data Analytics. I believe my love towards technology will take leaps and bounds in creating awesome projects that will help the open source community in the best possible way.
